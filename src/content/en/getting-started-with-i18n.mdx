Internationalization, often abbreviated as i18n, is the process of designing your application so it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. It is a foundational step before localization, which is the actual adaptation of content for a specific locale.

## Why Internationalization Matters

The web is global. Over 60% of internet users prefer to browse in a language other than English. By building with i18n from the start, you avoid costly refactors later and open your product to a much larger audience.

Consider these key benefits:

- **Market expansion** -- Reach users in new regions without rebuilding your application.
- **Better user experience** -- People engage more deeply with content in their native language.
- **SEO advantages** -- Localized content ranks better in regional search engines.

## Core Concepts

### Locale Identification

A locale is typically represented as a combination of language and region codes, such as `en-US` for American English or `ja-JP` for Japanese as used in Japan. The BCP 47 standard defines the format.

### Text Externalization

The first practical step is extracting all user-facing strings from your codebase into external resource files. This separation allows translators to work independently from developers.

```typescript
// Instead of hardcoding strings
const greeting = "Welcome back";

// Externalize them
const greeting = t("greeting.welcome_back");
```

### Locale-Aware Formatting

Numbers, dates, currencies, and even sorting order vary by locale. Modern frameworks provide APIs to handle this automatically.

```typescript
// Formats correctly for each locale
new Intl.NumberFormat("de-DE").format(1234.56); // "1.234,56"
new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US").format(1234.56); // "1,234.56"
```

## Implementation Strategy

Start with these steps:

1. Audit your codebase for hardcoded strings and locale-dependent formatting.
2. Choose an i18n framework that fits your stack.
3. Set up locale detection and routing.
4. Extract strings and establish a translation workflow.
5. Test with pseudo-localization before sending content to translators.

The investment pays off quickly. A well-internationalized application is easier to maintain and scale across markets.
